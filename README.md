# Electric-Vehicle-Modulation-Control-System-
This project involved designing a high-fidelity Electric Vehicle simulation in MATLAB/Simulink. I developed a closed-loop control system using a Longitudinal Driver with optimized PI gains to achieve precise velocity tracking. The model integrates a PWM-controlled H-Bridge, battery discharge dynamics, and environmental factors like road grade.
